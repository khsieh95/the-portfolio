## Summary

- Created a completely new portfolio with a new design approach.
- This portfolio is much different than the initial because it has more of my personal touch on it, rather than a template of what it could look like.

### Behind the scenes

- Sketched a layout of new design with pen and paper.
- Created basic html skeleton with designed rows/columns with border displayed.
- Added content one by one. Text followed by images.
- Used CSS to style and add features to links/images/cards, etc.
